Customer Churn Risk Analytics for a Subscription Business
Overview

This project analyzes customer churn risk in a subscription-based business and translates predictive insights into executive-ready decisions.

The work combines SQL analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence to identify high-risk customers, quantify revenue exposure, and recommend targeted retention actions.

All data used in this project is simulated for portfolio demonstration.

Business Problem

Customer churn directly impacts revenue and long-term growth.

The goal of this project is to:

Identify customers with elevated churn risk

Understand the main behavioral and acquisition drivers of churn

Quantify revenue exposure from potential churn

Deliver insights in a format suitable for executive decision-making

Solution Summary

The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow:

Simulated realistic subscription, transaction, and customer data

Built analytics tables using SQL in BigQuery

Engineered churn-related behavioral features

Trained a supervised churn prediction model

Scored customers with churn probabilities

Segmented customers into actionable risk groups

Delivered insights via a Power BI executive dashboard and one-page PDF summary

Key Outputs
